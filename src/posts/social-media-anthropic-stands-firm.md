# Social Media Posts — Anthropic Stands Firm

## Twitter / X (280 character limit)

**Character count: ~267**

> Anthropic said no to mass surveillance and autonomous weapons. They got called "woke" and "radical left" for it. Since when is "don't spy on Americans" a political stance? That's not left or right. That's common sense. I'm staying with Claude. #Anthropic #Claude #AI

> Anthropic refused to let Claude be used for mass surveillance of Americans or autonomous weapons. The response? They got called "radical left" and "woke." I'm not entirely left. I'm not entirely right. But I know that not wanting AI to spy on citizens or run weapons without human control isn't a political position — it's a human one. Disagreeing with how power wants to use technology doesn't make you radical. It means you're paying attention. Staying with Claude. #Anthropic #Claude #AI #Ethics
